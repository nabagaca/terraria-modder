A lightweight modding framework for Terraria 1.4.5. No tModLoader required.

## Fork Notice

This fork includes custom Storage Hub changes that align behavior more closely with Magic Storage-style networks and access flow.  
It is an unofficial fork and is not affiliated with the original TerrariaModder maintainers.

## Download

Get the latest release from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/terraria/mods/135), or follow build instructions below. Extract to your Terraria folder and run `TerrariaInjector.exe`.

## Create Your Own Mods

TerrariaModder is built to be modder-friendly. Everything you need to get started:

- **[Wiki & Guides](https://inidar1.github.io/terraria-modder/)** — Installation, first mod tutorial, Harmony basics, API reference, and walkthroughs of every included mod
- **[Starter Template](templates/ModTemplate)** — Ready-to-build mod template so you can have a working mod in minutes
- **Example Mods** — Every mod in this repo is open source with full source code. Use them as reference for real-world patterns
- **Built-in UI Library** — Panels, buttons, sliders, text fields, scrollable lists, tabs, and automatic colorblind support
- **Automatic Config UI** — Define config fields and the mod menu generates the settings UI for you

A GUI mod manager app is coming soon.

## Multiplayer

TerrariaModder is client-side only. Mods that only affect your own player (like keybinds, UI, and buffs) work fine in multiplayer. Mods that modify shared game state (chests, time, NPCs) are singleplayer only for now. Each mod page notes its multiplayer status. Full multiplayer support is planned for a future update.

## Building from Source

Requires [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and the [.NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48). Both are included with Visual Studio 2022.

```bash
# Build all mods
dotnet build src/Core/TerrariaModder.Core.csproj -c Release
dotnet build src/SkipIntro/SkipIntro.csproj -c Release
# ... etc for each mod in src/
```

Each mod builds to a single DLL. Place them in `Terraria/TerrariaModder/mods/<mod-id>/` alongside their `manifest.json`.
