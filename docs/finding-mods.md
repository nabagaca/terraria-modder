3. The mod's folder will appear under `TerrariaModder/mods/`
4. Launch game with TerrariaInjector.exe

Each mod zip extracts to its own folder:
```
TerrariaModder/
└── mods/
    └── mod-name/
        ├── manifest.json
        └── ModName.dll
```

## Evaluating Mods

Before installing a mod, consider:

### 1. Source Code Available?

Prefer mods with source code:
- You can verify what it does
- Community can audit for safety
- Easier to report/fix issues

## Mod Compatibility

### With TerrariaModder Core

Some mods specify a `framework_version` in manifest.json. If present:
- Must match or be lower than your installed Core version
- Higher version means you need to update Core
- Most mods omit this field and work with any Core version

### With Other Mods

Most mods are compatible with each other. Issues can arise if:
- Two mods patch the same method differently
- Keybind conflicts (configure in ModMenu)
- Both try to modify the same game data

### With Terraria Versions

Mods are built for specific Terraria versions:
- TerrariaModder targets Terraria 1.4.5
- Older/newer Terraria versions may have issues
- Check mod documentation for supported versions

## Troubleshooting

### Mod Not Loading

1. Check folder structure is correct
2. Verify manifest.json is valid
3. Check logs in `TerrariaModder/core/logs/terrariamodder.log`

### Mod Crashes Game

1. Disable the mod (delete or rename the mod folder temporarily)
2. Check logs for error messages
3. Report issue to mod author

### Keybind Conflicts

1. Open ModMenu (F6)
2. Go to the conflicting mod
3. Change keybind to unused key
