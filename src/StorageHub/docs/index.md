# Storage Hub Documentation

This is the dedicated documentation set for the `storage-hub` plugin.

It focuses on practical usage and implementation-specific behavior for the current fork.

## What You Will Find

- **Blocks and Recipes**: each block/item, what it does, and current crafting costs.
- **Progression and Disks**: tier unlocks, special unlocks, disk capacities, and upgrade costs.
